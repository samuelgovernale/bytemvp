Byte
Byte provides a seamless and modern way to speak with a personal chat bot to help you place food delivery orders and pay with cryptocurrency. The new UX for the world is human language. People want the white glove service of a personal assistant to place a food delivery order for them.

Description
This web application provides a seamless and modern way for users to order from fast food restaurants using cryptocurrency, ensuring a smooth transaction process and efficient delivery service. The integration with Coinbase and DoorDash, along with robust notification systems, ensures both user convenience and operational efficiency.

Our Byters are increasingly moving onchain to unbank themselves. Byters want to use DeFi or Coinbase as their checking account because they can get 4.75%-15% interest on their USDC compared to 0% in their bank account.

So what's missing? The crypto-native economy to buy goods and services, e.g. I want to spend my tendies from my BONK gains to buy some KFC tendies. We're onboarding the world onchain by connecting real-world services to the crypto economy.

Crypto native users are also increasingly pseudonymous. No one should have to provide their credit card and name to order food from DoorDash. My name is Ehrmantraut, send me some KFC, fren.

When Byters are hungry, they say "Byte me" and have an order placed in less than 1 minute.
